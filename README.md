👋 Hi, I’m @zheng0504. My username is inspired by the line:
“Endless is sorrow; in life, sorrow flows east like the river.”
The river never stops, nor do the questions and regrets we carry. Yes, I named myself—with a touch of poetry, and a trace of reflection.

👀 I scored 95 in politics on China’s college entrance exam, and once dreamed of entering the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Life had other plans, but my desire to understand how the world works remains unchanged.

🌱 These days, I’m exploring new interests and learning how to hold on to both ideals and reality—firmly, and without letting either slip.

⚡ A quiet fact: I once wrote out a perfectly structured life plan. But in the end, life turned out to be more like a playlist on shuffle—unpredictable, yet somehow with its own rhythm.
