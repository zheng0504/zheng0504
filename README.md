👋 Hi, I’m @zheng0504, real name: “Life’s Grief Flows East Like a River” (yeah, I named myself—poetic vibes included 😂).

👀 Scored 95 in politics on the Chinese college entrance exam and once dreamed of getting into the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Life had other plans, but that obsession with figuring out how the world works? Still here.

🌱 Currently juggling new interests and learning how to keep both ideals and reality in a firm grip ✊.

💞️ Collaboration? Depends on fate—and whether I’m awake or just staring at the ceiling.

📫 Reach me: comments or DMs are fine. Replies may vary depending on my mood for the day 😄.

⚡ Fun fact: I once had a perfectly organized life plan… then realized life is basically one big shuffle playlist.
